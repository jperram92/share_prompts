File Structure Explanation
Dynamic Routes:

app/posts/[postId]: This is a dynamic route. The [postId] folder signifies that this is a dynamic segment of the URL. When a user navigates to /posts/123 (for example), the postId will be set to 123, and this page will be rendered.
app/posts/new: This is a static route, used for creating new posts. It maps directly to /posts/new.
Nested Routes:

app/posts: This folder defines the base /posts route. Inside, you can have other nested routes like [postId] or new.
Layout and Error Handling:

app/layout.js: This file is used to define the layout for your application or specific sections. Layouts can be shared across multiple pages in your app.
app/error.js: Handles error boundaries. It catches errors in the app's routing and rendering process, displaying a fallback UI.
app/loading.js: This file handles the loading state, showing a loader while the page content is being fetched or rendered.
Other Files:

globals.css: Contains global CSS styling for the app.
favicon.ico: A file used for the site's icon in the browser tab.
How Routing Works in Next.js (with App Directory)
Page Files: Every .js file (like page.js or new.js) inside the app directory corresponds to a route. For example, app/posts/page.js maps to /posts, and app/posts/[postId]/page.js maps to /posts/:postId.

Dynamic Routes:

In app/posts/[postId], [postId] is a dynamic segment. It can match any value in the URL. The value of postId can be accessed using hooks like useRouter in React.
Layouts:

app/layout.js will wrap all pages under it, such as /posts, /posts/new, and dynamic routes like /posts/[postId]. You can define layout-specific UI elements, such as a sidebar or navigation menu.
Error and Loading:

app/error.js handles errors for the app or specific parts of it. Itâ€™s part of Next.js' built-in error handling system.
app/loading.js is used for showing a loading state when a page is being fetched, useful for slower or data-heavy pages.
Example Route Behavior:
/posts will load app/posts/page.js.
/posts/new will load app/posts/new.js.
/posts/:postId (e.g., /posts/1) will load app/posts/[postId]/page.js.
